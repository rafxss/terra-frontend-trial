# Directions
1. Develop the whole page in a responsive way that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
2. [Reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/4529266-Buttons-Set) for button interaction/hover (2nd one on the list). Color on hover: #F78BD8
3. Fonts used: [Red Hat Display (Google)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display) + [Work Sans (Google)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans)
4. Content & Images are part of this [REST API](https://tf-frontend.netlify.app/trial).
5. You are required to create one screen. The first time you access the page, the design should be displayed as on the left side. When you access the screen a second only the button changes, you should use local storage to accomplish it.
6. You can develop it using any framework that you want. Vanilla|React|Vue, etc.
